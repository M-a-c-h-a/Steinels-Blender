# Blender with Python


Blender Rocket Animation with Telemetry Data
This Python script is designed to animate a rocket model in Blender, updating its position and orientation based on telemetry data. It utilizes Blender's scripting capabilities to automate the animation process.

## Features

* The script simulates the movement of a rocket by updating its position and orientation.
* It includes a placeholder function to simulate receiving telemetry data, allowing users to customize it to integrate with real data sources.
* The rocket's orientation is determined by a custom driver function, providing flexibility in how the animation responds to telemetry data.

## Usage

* Ensure you have Blender installed on your system.

* Open Blender and create a new project or load an existing one.

* Add your rocket model to the scene and name it "Rocket".

* Open the Blender Text Editor and paste the provided Python script.

* Adjust the get_telemetry_data() function to receive real telemetry data if available.

* Run the script, and the animation will start playing, updating the rocket's position and orientation based on the telemetry data.

## Notes

Make sure that you modify this for future simulations, as this was a testing code, and is currently being fixed/updates - a reminder to update this for future people working on it!
